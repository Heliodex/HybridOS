# HybridOS
HybridOS v2 has now run its course, and we have moved onto working on HybridOS v10.

We've decided to set the program free and it will likely no longer be maintained.

This is the code for the original HybridOS v2.14.4 (codename cyborg), programmed by me and @Mantaraix in Python 3, for you to do whatever the heck you want with.

Credit to most code written in this program goes to StackOverflow.

The code was originally programmed at https://repl.it/@Heliodex/HybridOS .
