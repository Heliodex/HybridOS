# HybridOS
HybridOS has now run its course, and we have moved onto working on MonoOS.

We've decided to set the program free and it will likely no longer be maintained.

This is the code for the original HybridOS 2.14.4 (codename cyborg), programmed by me and @Mantaraix in Python, for you to do whatever the heck you want with.

Credit to most code written in this program goes to StackOverflow.

The code was originally programmed at https://repl.it/@Heliodex/HybridOS .
